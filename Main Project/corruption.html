        <h2><center>Corruption in India: Status, Causes & Impacts</center></h2>
<h2>What is Corruption?</h2>
<p>Transparency International (TI) defines corruption as “The abuse of entrusted power for private gain. 
It can be classified as grand, petty and political, depending on the amounts of money lost and the sector where it occurs”
What is the Status of corruption in India?
1.In 2021, the country was ranked 85th out of 180 in the Corruption Perceptions Index, with the lowest-ranked countries perceived 
  to have the most honest public sector. 
  Corruption is caused by a variety of factors, including officials stealing money from government social welfare programmes.
2.CPI, 2019 highlighted that unfair and opaque political financing, undue influence in decision-making and lobbying by powerful
  corporate interest groups, has resulted in stagnation or decline in the control of corruption.
3.As per the India Corruption Survey 2019, 51 percent of the respondents admitted to paying bribes. 
  Rajasthan and Bihar fared the worst in the country with 78 percent and 75 percent of respondents admitting to paying bribes.</p>
<h2>What are the causes of corruption?</h2>
<p>Inquiry into the causes of corruption presents a detailed picture of a socio-political-economic-administrative scenario that breeds 
corruption on a daily basis.</p>
<p>1.Lack of transparency in public institutions provides an environment conducive to corruption. When there is no transparency in
 government functioning, it is easier for officials to engage in corrupt practices without fear of detection or punishment.
2.The weak legal system in India is also a significant contributor to corruption. Corrupt officials can evade justice, and the lack of
 severe punishments acts as a deterrent to corrupt practices.
3.Political influence is another significant cause of corruption in India. Politicians use their power and influence to benefit
  themselves and their associates, often at the expense of the public interest.
4.Poverty and a lack of economic opportunities create an environment where corruption thrives. People in positions of power often
 exploit the vulnerable to engage in corrupt practices.
5.Despite various anti-corruption measures, a lack of political will to tackle corruption remains a significant challenge.</p>
<h3>Legacy issues–</h3>
<p>1.Rampant poverty and empty coffers of the government at the dawn of independence leading to chronic low salaries of the
   government officials.
2.Pre liberalization license permit raj catered by Monopolies and restrictive trade practices facilitated the corruption.
  The lack of economic freedom led to abuse of the system.
3.Necessities of development overshadowed vigilance procedures.
Corruption is a widespread problem in India that has been a matter of concern for several decades. It is a menace that plagues all levels
 of society, from the poorest to the richest. Corruption in India takes various forms, such as bribery, embezzlement, nepotism,
  and misuse of public resources.</p>
 <p>The root cause of corruption in India is a lack of transparency, accountability, and a weak legal system.</p>
  <h3> Consequences | </h3><p>Corruption in India has severe consequences on the country's social and economic development. 
It has resulted in the misallocation of resources, poor governance, and a lack of essential services to the people. Corruption has also 
undermined democracy and the rule of law, with political parties and leaders using corruption as a means to maintain power and control.</p>
  <h3> Measures | </h3><p> Indian government has taken several measures to address corruption, such as setting up anti-corruption agencies, 
enacting laws and regulations, and promoting transparency and accountability in public institutions. However, corruption
 remains a significant challenge in India, requiring continued efforts and political will to combat.</p>
<p>Citizens also have a crucial role to play in fighting corruption by refusing to participate in corrupt practices, reporting corruption, 
and demanding accountability from their leaders. Addressing corruption in India requires a collective effort from all stakeholders, 
including the government, civil society, and citizens, to build a more transparent, accountable, and fair society.</p>
 <p>Corruption often goes unchecked because of a lack of will to enforce laws and regulations.
Addressing the root causes of corruption in India requires a comprehensive approach that involves structural reforms, 
strengthening of institutions, and a change in societal attitudes towards corruption.
 It requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including the government, civil society, and citizens, 
 to build a more transparent, accountable, and fair society.</p>
