<p>“A average Indian is dissatisfied today” says the ‘World Happiness Report’ (2016) published by Sustainable Development Solutions Network which ranks India at 118/158 countries. It lies below many war torn nations like Palestine(108), Pakistan(81). etc. In common life we observe students unhappy about his college administration (FTII, NIT )a tenant un-happy about landlord, citizens blaming politicians of corruption (IAC), and the chain is infinite. Post LPG, with permeation of television, DTH, etc to farthermost corners, injection of consumerism in minds, etc. there has been rise in desires in people which has led to estrangement, jealousy, and self-centeredness. Happiness is lost in pursuit of overtaking one’s neighbour e.g. buying a longer car than his’, pressurising one’s child to score more than his neighbours’ child and similar demonstrative effects in other spheres of life. Common middle class Indian has turned into a money making robot lost somewhere between his office and home. Ironically, he still feels he is ‘normal’. There can be no cure without a diagnosis.
</p><p>
The solution to this conundrum lies ‘within’ us. Reconnecting to one’s internal self was the thought of this year’s World Culture Festival in Delhi. Appreciating the smaller beauties of life- a child’s smile, planting a tree, telling one’s parents that you love them and your children that you will always stand by them. We should be sincere and not serious in our pursuit of life.

In our pursuit to reconnect with our innate self, no other country in the world has done research greater than India. In a world fast breeding crime hatred, terrorism, restlessness, India is the peaceful future. But unfortunately our own GenX is turning away from it. Therefore, to be prepared for future we need to regularly consult our past. We should develop confidence through school syllabus, familial values, social media, etc .For example Yoga in school curriculum, World Culture Festival in Delhi, etc are cases in point. It also holds key to solving home-grown problems of Naxalism, terrorism, communalism, through peaceful means that would be sustainable and forge national unity.
ONLY after the establishing people’s democracy and completing the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, anti-monopoly capital tasks can the Indian people advance towards socialism. What does socialism in Indian conditions mean? While no blueprint can be detailed until the people’s democratic revolution is successfully completed, we can only outline and develop further our understanding contained in our earlier ideological documents:

</p>• It means providing all people food security, full employment, universal access to education, health and housing. It means the economic, political and social empowerment of the people by vastly improving the living conditions of workers, peasants and the hitherto marginalised sections.
<p>It means, first and foremost, that people’s power would be supreme. That democracy, democratic rights and civil liberties would be inseparable elements of the socialist juridical, political and social order. Under bourgeois democracy, illusionary formal rights may exist but the majority of people are denied the capacities to exercise these rights. Under socialism, democracy will be based on the economic, educational and social empowerment of all people, the fundamental and essential requirement for the continuous deepening and development of the quality of human life, on whose foundations socialist democracy will flourish. Under socialism, the right to dissent, the freedom of expression and plurality of opinion will flourish with the aim of strengthening socialism under proletarian statehood.</p>
</p>
<p>Te struggle between socialist, restrictive state-managed economic policies and the beneﬁts of a more open democratic
society continues in India as the challenges of addressing the COVID-19 pandemic reduce growth and increase prospects
for government intervention. Internal division, communal tensions, and self-defeating Hindu nationalism must be put to
the side together with socialist and paternalistic policies that undercut growth. </p><p>If these issues are not addressed with energyand eﬀective implementation, India’s history of low growth will return and opportunities for strengthening India against theaggressive, expansionist power of China will be lost.
India’s case provides a dramatic illustration of the positive, life-changing results of addressing fundamental structural reformsand introducing free-market, capitalist economic policies of the kind India adopted in the 1990s and after 2004. Tese diﬃcult
policy actions, given India’s long history of socialism and state management of economic policies, brought major growth
beneﬁts from 2004 on, until the shock of events around the COVID-19 virus and the apparent weakening of the government's continuing commitment to free-market, growth-oriented policies began to have negative eﬀects.</p>
