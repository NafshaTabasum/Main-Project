<div class="text"><h1>WAY TO RIGHT CULTURE</h1></div></div><br>
<p>The important characteristics of Indian Culture are civilized communication, beliefs, values, etiquette, and rituals. India is well known for its 'Unity in Diversity' across the world. That means India is a diverse nation where many religious people live together peacefully having their own different cultures.</p>
<p>These are some of my observations about our Indian culture in general. Irrespective of whether you are a Hindu, Muslim, North or South Indian there are some general features which we all share. I am only writing about the negative ones because these are the ones that drew my attention while analyzing the reasons for our misery which makes us Indians rank 126th out of 137 countries in the world happiness index. I am aware that Indians are a very intelligent, hardworking, thrifty lot who invests in house, family wealth etc: to build up a strong and rich lineage but in spite of all this I feel that life in India is a struggle and pain which could be avoided if we understand certain things about our culture.</p>
<p>The first cultural aspect which I feel is ingrained in our minds is “Respect for Elders”. This appears to be innocuous and even healthy but if we see closely, it is an euphemism for suppression of the younger generation by the elders. Be it a father or grandfather at home, a teacher in school, a boss in an office, government servants, and police in public life all the seniors and elders suppress their juniors even though they may be talented. They do this to control them but in the bargain, they stop the growth of the institution wherever they are. Happiness can be achieved by giving a part of ourselves to others, especially to our younger generation, which is easily possible and carried forward into this world.</p>
<p>In continuation of the above point, extracting money, respect, work, etc: from the younger generation for the benefit of the older generation is also a common practice in India. Parents may be poor but they will glorify their struggles to the children so that they are always held in high respect by them and are obliged to give them money, respect, and care all throughout their lives, thus thwarting their growth. When a daughter-in-law comes into a house, she is looked upon as a person from whom work, money, and respect has to be extracted and in the event she is not able to satisfy them and their expectations, she along with her family is held at ransom. This deprives the boy’s family of the opportunity of obtaining happiness by way of giving.</p>
<p>Making the others a source of money: Many times we see in joint families where businesses are in the hands of few, these few tend to control all finances and govern the household. The others are content with getting less money but still staying dependent on one or two persons. So on average when one person earns, he has an average of 4 persons dependent on him. This is also seen while earning money. Hardly when one person has set up a shop to do any business, there will be many people like municipality, police, local goons, etc: who come to collect money (popularly known in local parlance as ‘Hafta’) on a regular basis. This tendency to see the ‘Other Person’ as a source of money rather than our own selves as the source, reduces total productivity and leads to bad relationships between people.</p>
<p>Making relationships a source of money: There are many businesses that are based on relationships for e.g. agencies of certain monopoly businesses, administrative jobs such as the collection of tolls, excise duty, entry tax, etc: which are distributed on the basis of relationships where the prime requirement is the loyalty of that person. It is OK to some extent to earn in this manner but if we make a relationship or friendship our source of income then it is not likely to generate a good amount of money and the law of diminishing returns comes into play.</p>
<p>Dowry: Where dowry exists it is obviously a social evil but the basis of dowry is very inhuman. It is the total rejection of the value of a bride’s femininity whereby it is considered that a girl is simply a burden and just has to be fed so that she may reproduce. It is also conceding the fact that the man is not strong enough and needs extra money to support his wife. Actually one marries because he has become an adult and is capable of giving love and support to another life. Indians are very keen to have children but as they do not see themselves strong enough to support a wife and child, the boy or his family constantly demands money from the girl’s side to support them. This robs them of the happiness which they are supposed to get by giving to the new mother and her child. If one does not feel strong enough then he should not marry at all.</p>
<p>Religion plays a large role in the daily life of Indians. There are temples, mosques, churches, and scores of idols of varying sizes, shapes, and colors belonging to various communities and castes, everywhere. People make it a point to bow down their heads whenever they pass a temple, make a sign of kissing their foreheads and hand while passing a mosque or a saint’s grave, make a cross sign while passing a church, and so on. People also believe in each other’s religion to the extent of seeking blessing from their God or saint in the hope that their work gets done. Some travelers have said that “more the places of worship in a place, God resides a bit less over there”. This means that the more the people profess to be externally religious, the more they feel meek in this world and they submit themselves to their Gods for receiving (psychological) strength.</p>
<p>While one cannot contest another’s claim to their belief, one can certainly make some observations about what a particular group professes to believe and what that group practices. We know that in India, people, in general, are not very trustworthy, whatever their justifications for doing so, maybe. People’s words cannot be taken at face value. One does not know what the other person means when he says either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ until he practices what he says. Our quality of goods is not up to the mark, honesty in public life is practically non-existent, one cannot rely on another’s word, etc: All this makes us waste our time, effort, money, and energy in pursuing what could have been achieved with less of these. Our efficiency goes down because of constant wrangling and arguing over simple things which makes us exhausted without achieving much.</p>
<p>We Indians in general have tremendous ‘Inferiority Complex’ meaning we put a low value on ourselves. Well, this may be due to poverty but in spite of achieving many things in life, one always feels inferior or low hence he is afraid to stand alone with his ideas or beliefs hence we always go after big, strong, established people who will see us through life. Our Gods are huge and tremendously rich (created by us only), we allow our politicians or leaders to become powerful at our expense so that they can lead us through thick and thin, and in this process, we even overlook their crimes too.</p>
<p>Our relation to ‘Sex’ is complex. While all of us like to have sexual pleasure and to a large extent the population gets it from marriage, we basically regard sex as something bad or necessary evil that has to be had and got over and done with. The words we use to refer to sex are ‘Galat/Ganda Kaam’, ‘Galat /Gande Vichaar’, Galat/ Gandi baat, etc: While rape can be rightly regarded as a bad act or ‘Dush Karm’ still one can smell the hatred for the act rather than regarding it simply as a crime. This is in contrast to the fact that while mentioning other crimes like theft, lying, and cheating they are not regarded so much of an evil as ‘sex’ be it consensual or rape. India is probably the only country now where squads of police roam gardens or sites where couples sit for privacy, attacking them as if they are committing some crime. It is not important how much sex goes on or how many people have sex, what is important is how do we regard sex; whether as a normal pleasurable human activity or something abnormal and evil.</p>
<p>In sex and love, there is a lot of giving to do. If one loves his or her partner then he/she must give unconditionally in order to get happiness provided the partner is trustworthy and equally loving. Indians usually think in terms of ‘Having’ sex or having some fun as if it is had at the expense of another. Women too mostly think of getting something in return for sex or even marriage rather than loving or giving love.</p>
<p>For marriage, nature has arranged it in such a way that it is the male who selects a lady based on her beauty and nature and approaches her. In this way, he accepts her and is ready to take on the responsibility of maintaining her. She has the pleasure of being accepted for what she is and this seems to be nature’s design in the formation of a couple. In India, in many families, it is the girl’s family who goes to look around for a boy and mostly it is these families who give dowry or money in other forms. Now when a girl or her family looks around for a boy, they will only see whether he will look after her or not in terms of food, shelter, and basic social network. They are not likely to see his nature or hobbies etc: This is a ‘Survival Psychology’ where the girl is simply looking for being looked after for survival. This is not likely to bring happiness to the couple and subsequently to society.</p>
<p>All these things not only apply to India and Indians but are present the world over to a  smaller or a larger extent but I am bringing up these points because I am concerned about us and how to achieve happiness in our environment and our culture.</p>
