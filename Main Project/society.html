<p>India suffers from a host of social issues ranging from poverty to gendered violence. This article covers the concept of social issues and highlights the different experiences of rural and urban sectors. Further, it studies six important social issues namely poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, the caste  system,  gendered  violence  and  communalism  by  analysing  their  causes  and  the  specific measures adopted to combat them. Poverty is one of the leading social problems in India. Poverty basically means  the unavailability  of adequate  means of  money  to  fulfil  the  basic requisites  of human life such as food, shelter, clothes, health and education. Poverty is not only socio-economic but even emotional, cultural and political in nature.   As India is one of the most overpopulated nations, it is one of the major factors leading to poverty. Rural areas are mostly affected by it. Poverty basically indicates three things- economic dependence, economic insufficiency, and economic inequality.   The social  issues like poverty, unemployment, migration, crime, delinquency, drug abuse, child abuse,  crime against  women,  crime  against  children, discrimination  on  the basis  of Caste, class & religion ,  corruption, family and health problems, education, political, economic, cultural and  environment issues  and human  rights  violation  all  need  to  be  seen  in the  socio  economic repercussions.   Steadily rising  crimes  against women and  minorities, intolerance towards  other  religious communities, lack of employment opportunities for the steadily rising population and insufficient schemes to eradicate poverty can be termed as the major social issues facing India. We people are talking more about the social issues in society but only marginal people are willing to do work on it in practical manner this is harsh reality of our society. If we want to change then we have to work collectively to eliminate these problems. Hope we all understand the social responsibilities. Keywords: Poverty, Unemployment, Corruption, and Economic Inequality.</p>
<p> An individual  problem is one that affects only a particular individual or group. On the other hand, public  issues  are  those faced  by  society as  a whole.  A social  issue  is  when a  situation is deemed less than the social  ideal. It must result  in  unfavourable  circumstances  that  can  only be handled collectively. India has undergone many changes in  the last decades. Social change brings with  it  a  new  set  of  circumstances  wherein  an  otherwise  overlooked  issue  might  be  given importance. For example, the population explosion in India was not viewed as a serious issue until the 1950s. It is also important to note that any problem only becomes a social issue when enough number of  people find it undesirable. </p>
<h2>POVERTY</h2>
<p>Poverty is one of the leading social problems in India. Poverty basically means the unavailability of adequate  means  of money to  fulfil the basic  requisites of  human life  such as  food, shelter  and clothes. Poverty is not only socio-economic but even emotional, cultural and political in nature.    As India is one of the most overpopulated nations, it is one of the major factors leading to poverty. Rural areas are mostly affected by it. Poverty basically indicates three things- economic dependence, economic insufficiency, and economic inequality.    The sociologist David Elesh determined three causes of poverty namely individual, culture of poverty and  social structure. The first ideology is propagated by those who believe that if an individual ends up in poverty, it is their own fault and due to a lack of hard work and initiative. This thought is rooted  in  the  functionalist approach  of  sociology.  It  maintains that poverty is  a  good thing for society since it propagates the survival of the fittest. The culture of poverty concept was introduced  in  1959 by Oscar  Lewis. He  believed that the  lifestyle  of  the lower socio-economic classes‟ fostered behaviours and attitudes associated with poverty. Hence, no amount of economic ehabilitation could help alleviate the poor. Finally, the social structure approach was propagated by sociologist Herbert Gans. He associated poverty with unjust social conditions and pointed out that the middle and higher classes had a vested interest in the poor. For example, the existence of the poor helped alleviate their social status. Thus, they had no interest in changing the social structure  </p>
<p><h3>Causes of poverty in India:-</h3> 
 Unemployment- The unemployment rate in India is quite very high, which results in the people  coming under the poverty line.<br>  Rise in the price- It is said that the rich are getting richer, and the poorer are getting poorer. This is just because of the increasing price of goods that the poor cannot afford.<br>  Less productivity in farming- Farming is one of the foremost means of livelihood for the people of India, and due to the seasonal changes,  the production  in agriculture  are  quite uncertain.  This  is  also a  contributing factor  to poverty</p>
<h2>HEALTHCARE SYSTEM</h2>
<p>It  is  true  that  the  world‟s  most  populous  democratic  country cannot  provide  proper healthcare facilities to its entire population. India is becoming a hub for medical tourism but all these facilities are not available to local residents, who happen to be poor. Healthcare is a neglected issue in India, as major attention drawers are agriculture, infrastructure and IT. Lack of resources in rural India is a major concern of the day, leading to most of the problems. 50 percent of all villagers have no access to healthcare  providers;  Infant  Mortality  Rate  (IMR)  is 34  per  1000 live  births;  lack  of  nutrition caused stunning growth in 50% of all the babies, and 36% people in India have no access to toilets. </p>
<p><h3>Causes of poor health care system in India:-</h3>
  Lack of infrastructure: India has been struggling with deficient infrastructure in the form of lack of well-equipped medical institutes for quite a while now. To add to it, the rate of building such medical teaching or training facilities remains less as compared to the need of the hour. <br> Shortage of efficient and trained manpower: One of the most pressing problems in India remains a severe shortage of trained manpower in the medical  stream,  this  includes doctors,  nurses,  paramedics  and  primary  healthcare  workers. The situation remains worrisome in rural areas, where almost 66 per cent of India‟s population reside<br>  Unmanageable patient-load: Even prior  to the  outbreak of  the Covid-19  pandemic, healthcare  facilities  had  been feeling the strain due to unmanageable patient-load. Moreover, serving a population of 1.4 billion remains a Herculean task in itself when it comes to suitably managing healthcare facilities. <br> Public health policy and proactive healthcare: The latest National Health  Policy (NHP)  2017 highlights the „Health for  All‟ approach to provide assured healthcare for all at an affordable cost. However, there is scope to do much more under the NHP 2017. Ideally, the public health policy needs to be focussed towards proactive healthcare, not reactive healthcare <br> High out-of-pocket expenditure remains a stress factor: While public hospitals offer free health services, these facilities are understaffed, poorly equipped, and located mainly in urban areas. It is a known fact that accessible and affordable healthcare in the public  sector  can  considerably  reduce  the  rise  in  dependence  on  private  institutions.  However, governmental facilities leave no alternatives but to access  private institutions  and  incurring  high out-of-pocket  expenses  in  healthcare.  Most  health  services  are,  therefore,  provided  by  private facilities, and 65 per cent of medical expenses in India are paid out of pocket by patients. </p>
<h2>UNEMPLOYMENT</h2>
<p>The defective  education  system fails  to  give  importance  to  primary  education  and  vocational training. The benefits of education are mostly availed only by middle- and high-income youth with access  to  private  schools  and  universities.  The  conditions  in  most  government  schools  are unsuitable for studying and are often a result for many girls to drop out (Ahuja 2014).   Unemployment is a global phenomenon where a person who is willing to work fails to get a job to earn to fulfil his basic needs. It is a growing social issue in India. In a nutshell, society fails to provide a means of earning for the non-disabled man.   With  a  high  rate  of  the  population,  India  is  facing  unemployment  issues,  which  is responsible for  the rise in the poverty level, social tension, diseases, corruption, crimes,  and low productivity.</p>
<p><h3>Causes of unemployment:-</h3>
  The literacy rate in India is quite meagre. Due to the inappropriate or insufficient education system does not make the people fit for working in various fields.<br>  As agriculture  is the backbone of our country, 90 percent of Indians depends on agriculture for their livelihood. And agriculture is a gamble in the hand of the monsoon; hence, due to this seasonal nature of agriculture, the agricultural labourers work less.<br>  A case study on social issues in India demonstrates that the higher growth of the population is also a factor for the increasing unemployment and poverty. </p>
<h2>OVERPOPULATION</h2>
<p>Population is rising at  an alarming rate in India  making  overpopulation  an urgent and important issue. Indians are ignoring the soon to burst-overpopulation bomb. According to UN reports (2015) one-fifth  of  Indians are  living  below the  poverty  line and  almost  one fourth  of  the Indians  are illiterate even after 73 years of independence. The problem of over population is prevalent mainly in  poor  and  developing  countries.  The  illiteracy  and  poverty  are  interrelated.  Where  there  is illiteracy,  there  is  poverty  and  vice  versa.  The  Government  is  increasing  investment  in  many infrastructure projects</p>
<p>Overpopulation is a major social issue in India. It is increasing very rapidly. Such a rise in population is a sombre aspect of the economic development of India. The population growth has led to several problems such as scarcity of food, clothes, employment and shelter, and the demands of the resources have peaked.</p>
<p><h3>Causes of overpopulation:-</h3>
  Illiteracy– As the literacy rate in India is meagre; the people are unaware of the population explosion. People do not have any idea about family planning which gives rise in population. <br> Need of a male child– as in our India, a son is given much priority compared to a girl. It is believed that  son will perform all the religious rites. So for getting a male child, the people give birth to daughters, ultimately increasing the population</p>
<h2>BASIC SANITATION</h2>
<p>Sanitation is more important than political independence – Mahatma Gandhi.   The term sanitation generally stands for the supplying of services and facilities for the safe management and  disposal  of  human  excreta  and sewage,  and, more  generally, solid  and animal waste </p>
<p><h3>Reasons for poor sanitation in India are as follows:-</h3>
*Sanitation is one of  the methods to provide primary health  care  to the actual need of  the community possibly through minimising the level of pollutants in the environment.   India, having 14 percent of world‟s total population suffers by 50 percent of world‟s total  diseases due to poor sanitation. <br> Low priority accorded to sanitation  <br> Lack of felt need<br>   Lack of coordination between different implementing agencies<br>  Inadequate sectorial planning <br> Illiteracy and ignorance <br>  Lack of infrastructure.<br>  Weak and inefficient institutional mechanism.<br>  Inadequate trained human resources<br>  Inadequate financial resources.<br>  Lack of community participation and inadequate health education facilities. <br> Lack of private sector participation.  <br> The problem of rural sanitation is further complicated due to social and attitudinal problems. A large percentage of our population is poor, illiterate and socially dis-organised so, these do not realise, the  importance of  sanitation. The  sanitation  programme  will be  successful only through people‟s involvement and by designing a system which is suitable to the sociocultural attitudes and customs of the people. </p>
<h2>CHILD LABOUR </h2>
<p>“A Child is a father of the Man”   -William Wordsworth   Child  Labour is a  'harsh reality' and one  can  only mitigate some of  the  harshness of  the exploitative aspects of Child Labour. The 'harsh reality' of Child Labour arises out of the fact that in the present state of development in the country many parents, on account of poverty, have to send their children to work in order to supplement their income and the income derived from the Child Labour, however to do  work is  essential  to sustain the  family. This  is  the  'poverty argument  of Child Labour</p>
<p><h3>Causes of child labour:-</h3> 
 Poverty- The biggest cause of child labour is poverty. People below the poverty line do not have sufficient money to afford education for their children. As a result, the children are forced to help their parents in earning money.   
<br>  Unemployment by the elders- Another factor  towards child labour is the unemployment by the elders, which compel a  child to leave his dreams and childhood and earn money for the two squares meal for his/her family. <br> Migration of the families- The migration of  families from rural to urban areas is also a major  factor for child labour. They migrate to get better earning opportunities in the cities; however, their children become child labour when such thing is not met. <br> Overpopulation- Overpopulation causes the limitation on the resources and more mouth to feed. So the children are bound to be child labour.</p>
<h2>WOMEN’S SAFETY </h2>
<p>Both men and women enjoy equal opportunities, but as far  as freedom and safety of women are concerned, India lags behind. Issues like domestic violence, rape, the portrayal of women in media, etc., must be tackled immediately.</p>
<p><h3>Causes of women safety concern:-  </h3>
  Apart from feeling unsafe on roads when it gets dark, women go through a lot of different Women‟s rights violations. <br>  Women trafficking, dowry deaths, domestic violence, child marriage, women forced to give birth  to only sons,  female foeticides,  forced evictions  and  exclusions, sexual  harassment at  the workplace, rapes are prevalent across the world. <br> Something as basic as education which might be normal for a boy is still a dream for many girls in India.   These are some of the ill-happenings which are used by the male to display male superiority. This is one of the prime reason violence is increasing in India, and women‟s safety is a concern in India.</p>
<p>There are a lot of social issues we are facing right now, some more prominent than the others. First of all, poverty is a worldwide issue. It gives birth to a lot of other social issues which we must try to get away with at the earliest. Social Issues is an undesirable state which opposes society or a certain part of society. It refers  to  an  unwanted situation that frequently results  in  problems  and continues to harm society. Social issues can cause a lot of problems that can be beyond the control of just one person. Moreover, child labour is another major social issue that damages the lives of young children. Similarly, illiteracy also ruins the lives of many by destroying their chances of a bright future.            In  India  mostly,  poverty,  corruption,  unemployment,  drug  addiction,  lack  of  proper sanitation  and  proper  health  infrastructure  etc.,  still  exists  and  is  responsible  for  the  lack  of development.  We  must all  come  together  to  fight against  them and  put  them  to  an end  for the development of the society</p>
